# Revenue Tax Split Calculator

A simple interactive Python program that helps Irish residents calculate and proportionally divide their **annual income** and **tax credits** across multiple jobs based on hours worked and hourly pay. Useful when updating your Revenue profile for multiple employments.

## Features

- Collects the number of jobs, tax credits, and annual income
- Gathers details for each job:
  - Company name
  - Weekly hours
  - Hourly salary
- Calculates:
  - Estimated annual income per job
  - Proportional share of total income
  - Allocated tax credits and income for each job

## Example Use Case

If you have 2 jobs:
- Job A: 20 hours/week at €15/hour
- Job B: 30 hours/week at €12/hour

And you earn €30,000/year with €3,300 in tax credits, the program calculates how to split this fairly between both jobs, based on actual workload and pay.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the script.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python tax_split_calculator.py
